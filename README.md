# Mobile Price Range Prediction
 ### The dataset contains 20 different Features of mobile phones which correspond to the labels (Price range) as 0(low cost), 1(medium cost), 2(high cost) and 3(very high cost).         
### Data Visualization using seaborn for getting a visual understanding of which Features mainly contribute towards the Labels.
 
### Data Cleansing and extracting the main features using "Numpy" and "Pandas"
 
 ### Linear Regressiono and Knn to estimate MSE and Accuracy and for prediction of Price range on  test data.
 
### Deployed using Streamlit 
 
  #### As a learner and to enhance my skills I have tried my best to improve the accuracy of the Model to 83%. 
   
### Libraries Used
#### Numpy , Pandas, Matplotlib,Sklearn.
